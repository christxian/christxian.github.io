# Research

Through advocacy and support for alternatives to punitive systems, I aim to promote approaches that prioritize community care and reduce reliance on coercive methods. I collaborate closely with community partners, including mutual aid groups and street medicine teams, to ground my work in grassroots knowledge and lived experience. This approach seeks to bridge academic research with practical action to address systemic inequalities in housing, healthcare, and social support.

- Governance and criminalization of homelessness and poverty in the U.S.

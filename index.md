  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I’m a PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work. I earned my MSW from Pitt and my BSW from Eastern Michigan University. Before starting my doctoral work, I spent time working in psychiatric emergency services, domestic violence shelters, and homeless shelters. These experiences made me deeply aware of how overlapping systems impact people’s lives and push me to question how social work operates within them.</p>

  <p>I also volunteer with mutual aid groups, supporting grassroots responses to community needs that challenge institutional models. My research focuses on housing and healthcare disparities, especially how policies and frontline interventions can reduce the harms of coercive or punitive systems.</p>

  <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
  <p>I believe learning is relational and political. My teaching is grounded in constructivism and critical pedagogy, meaning I see knowledge as something we co-create together—something shaped by our lived experiences and shaped by power. Teaching isn’t just about content delivery; it’s about asking hard questions: Who decided this is worth knowing? Who has been excluded from this history?</p>

  <p>In social work education, we must honestly examine the profession’s complicity in carceral systems and other forms of structural violence. I push students to critique the systems they’re entering, and to imagine what social work could be outside of those systems. My goal is to support students in becoming ethical, curious, and critical practitioners who see themselves as part of broader struggles for justice.</p>

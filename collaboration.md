# Collaboration

Iâ€™m available for trainings, guest lectures, or collaborative consulting on topics related to:

- Harm reduction  
- Mutual aid infrastructure  
- Anti-carceral housing and mental health policy  
- De-escalation strategies and alternatives to policing  
- Street-based outreach practices  
- Critical pedagogy and social work education   

If you're interested in working together, feel free to reach out! I'm always open to community-driven, justice-oriented projects.
